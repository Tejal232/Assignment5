            <p>
                Welcome, intrepid explorer! The ocean is Earth's last great frontier, a vast, mysterious world teeming with life and untold secrets. From the shallow, sunlit coral reefs to the crushing darkness of the abyssal plain, every corner holds something incredible. Join us as we journey into the wonders of the deep.

            <h3>The Giants Below: Whales and Sharks</h3>
            <p>
                The ocean is home to the largest creatures on Earth, including magnificent whales and powerful sharks. Whales, like the blue whale, are gentle giants that filter feed on tiny krill, while sharks, often misunderstood, are crucial predators that keep marine ecosystems healthy. Each dive reveals more about their fascinating lives and behaviors.

            <h3 id="creatures">Unseen Life: From Plankton to Anglerfish</h3>
            <p>
                Beyond the large animals, the ocean is a microscopic universe of **plankton**, the foundation of the marine food web. As we descend into the darker zones, we encounter bizarre and beautiful creatures like the **anglerfish**, with its bioluminescent lure, and the alien-like **giant squid**, rarely seen by human eyes.

                <h3>The Enigma of Deep-Sea Vents</h3>
                <p>
                    Did you know that life thrives in places without sunlight? Around **hydrothermal vents**, hot, mineral-rich water erupts from the seafloor. Here, unique communities of tube worms, crabs, and strange bacteria flourish, proving that life can exist in the most extreme conditions imaginable. This section shows how a **relative** container anchors an **absolute** element. The badge is positioned *inside* this box, not the whole page.

                    Scientists continue to explore these incredible environments, finding new species with every expedition.

            <h3 id="mysteries">Oceanic Mysteries Yet Unsolved</h3>
            <p>
                The ocean holds countless mysteries. Where do the lost ships of the past truly rest? What unknown creatures lurk in the deepest trenches? How do global currents truly influence our climate? Every research expedition brings us closer to understanding these profound questions, but many still remain.
            </p>
            <p>
                The vastness and inaccessibility of the deep ocean mean that we have explored less than 5% of it. Imagine what else is waiting to be discovered!
            </p>

            <p>
                The ocean plays a vital role in regulating Earth's climate, producing oxygen, and providing food resources for billions of people. Protecting this incredible environment is more important now than ever before.
